# asyncio_multiclient_messenger_server

The project was made to demonstrate how to create server based on asyncio module streams. The server can serve many clients simultaneously. The server successfully recieve messeges from clients and the resend it to the correct receivers. 

The server can be used as a base example for messenger projects of for multiplayer games.

The project can be used in multiple ways: to add reall database to store messages, to add ssl to encrypt messages, add clients authorization, create GUI instead of console interface for client and many other choices, it's up to you how to use the code.

As usual feel free to use the code in your projects, if you have questions ask me kozirev8@gmail.com
